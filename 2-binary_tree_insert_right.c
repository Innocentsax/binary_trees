/**
 * binary_tree_insert_right - inserts a node as the

 *
 * Description: If parent already has a right-child, the new node
 *				must take its place, and the old right-child must
 *				be set as the right-child of the new node.
 *
 * Return: a pointer to the created node, or
 *			NULL on failure or
 *			if parent is NULL
